# Hello, World!

Hi, my name is Justin...and I'm focused on developing tools, systems, and processes to enable the application of artificial intelligence in real-world contexts.

My repos are consolidated according to AI fields and additional high level personal interests. Each repo will closely follow leading texts on the topics; which can be found in the repo's readme.
