# Hello, World!

Hi, my name is Justin...and I'm focused on developing tools, systems, and processes to enable the application of artificial intelligence in real-world contexts.

In early 2022, I decided to consolidate projects into mono-repos according to AI fields and additional high level personal interests.

These repos and the organization are meant to be used as a curriculum. Each repo will closely follow appropriate texts.
